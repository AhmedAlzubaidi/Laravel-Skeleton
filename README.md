# Laravel Skeleton â€“ Project Overview

This project is a reusable **Laravel skeleton** designed to serve as a solid foundation for building clean, modular, and scalable Laravel APIs. It applies modern design patterns, architecture principles, and a curated set of packages.

---

## ðŸ§± Architecture & Design Principles

- **Action Pattern** (via [Laravel Actions](https://github.com/lorisleiva/laravel-actions))
  - All business logic lives in **Action classes**.
  - Two categories:
    - **Endpoint Actions**
      - Used to serve public API requests.
      - Located in `app/Http/Endpoints`
      - Follow the naming convention: `CreateUserEndpoint`, `LoginUserEndpoint`
    - **Internal Actions**
      - Used for non-endpoint business logic (e.g., image processing, data updates).
      - Located in `app/Actions`
      - Follow the naming convention: `UpdateProfileImage`, `SyncRoles`

- **Routes**
  - API routes are defined in `routes/api.php`
  - Routes are RESTful, structured around resources (e.g., `/api/users`, `/api/orders`).
  - Each route delegates to a single Endpoint Action, often following the REST method-to-action naming convention.

## ðŸ§© Example: Users Resource
```php
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Route;
use App\Http\Endpoints\Users\{
    GetUsersEndpoint,
    GetUserEndpoint,
    CreateUserEndpoint,
    UpdateUserEndpoint,
    DeleteUserEndpoint
};

Route::prefix('users')->group(function () {
    Route::get('/', GetUsersEndpoint::class);          // index
    Route::get('/{id}', GetUserEndpoint::class);       // show
    Route::post('/', CreateUserEndpoint::class);       // store
    Route::put('/{id}', UpdateUserEndpoint::class);    // update
    Route::delete('/{id}', DeleteUserEndpoint::class); // destroy
});
```

- **Service Layer**
  - Located in `app/Services`
  - For interacting with external services, APIs, or microservices.

- **Form Requests & Custom Validation Rules**
  - Located in `app/Http/Requests` and `app/Rules`
  - Standardized validation flow using Laravelâ€™s `FormRequest`.

- **Enum Usage**
  - Located in `app/Enums`
  - For type-safe representation of status, roles, types, etc.
